# IT Project - gebarentaaltool

<div>
  <h2>Introduction and About Us</h2>
   <p>Welcome to our repository for IT Project, this project was given by our profs from the Erasmus University College Brussels.</p>
   <p>Our team consits of a Product Owner Gust Berchmans and 4 developers: Iben Vanthournout, Jente Tavernier, Senne Clauwaert, Bilal Belkasem.</p>
   <h2>The Problem</h2> 
   <p>People who use SMOG or wish to learn it face significant barriers in communication and accessibility due to the lack of engaging tools and real-time solutions. This limits their ability to connect with others in personal, educational, and professional contexts.</p>
   <h2>Our Solution</h2>
   <p>Our solution is a sign language translator app designed to support SMOG. It bridges the communication gap between signers and non-signers while offering an engaging way to learn SMOG.</p>
   <p>Our app empowers users to:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Translate gestures into text in real-time.</li>
      <li>Learn SMOG interactively through tailored lessons.</li>
      <li>Track their progress through gamified elements, including a statistics page showcasing milestones and achievements.</li>
   </ul>
